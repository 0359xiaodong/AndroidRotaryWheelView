 
Android Rotary Wheel Menu
-------------------------

I wanted to implement a widget similar to the [Rotating Wheel Control with UIKit]( http://www.raywenderlich.com/9864/how-to-create-a-rotating-wheel-control-with-uikit )
but on Android so I had to write my own, it is far from complete and it is drawn in an ugly way.

But at least the main functionality that selects a sector from the pie works without any problems.

Feel free to fork the project and please notify me, when you enhance it.


Thanks for Jason Valestin's [radial-menu-widget](http://code.google.com/p/radial-menu-widget/) for giving me the idea of how 
to draw a Pie.
